# Ensembles and individual model plots

-   Most accurate model results:

    -   Predicted vs actual

        -   Discussion of most accurate predicted vs actual

    -   Residuals

        -   Discussion of residuals from the most accurate model

    -   Histogram of residuals

        -   Discussion of the histogram of residuals from the most accurate model

    -   Q-Q plot

        -   Discussion of the Q-Q plot from the most accurate model

    -   Mean accuracy for train, test, validation, and holdout (mean of test and validation) sets

    -   Barchart of model accuracy

        -   Measures mean Root Mean Squared Error, from low to high

        -   Includes 1 standard deviation error bars

    -   Insert model accuracy numbers with standard deviations

    -   Insert model accuracy bar chart with 1 standard deviation error bars here

-   Bias

    -   `bias` computes the average amount by which `actual` is greater than `predicted`.

    -   If a model is unbiased `bias(actual, predicted)` should be close to zero. Bias is calculated by taking the average of (`actual` - `predicted`).

    -   Insert bias plot here

-   Holdout / Train

    -   Calculates the mean of the holdout RMSE / mean of the train RMSE across the samples. Closer to one is better.

    -   Insert table for holdout / train numbers

    -   Insert plot for holdout / train chart here

-   Duration

    -   Calculates the mean duration for each model

    -   Insert barchart for duration here

-   t-test with p-values

    -   Performs one and two sample t-tests on vectors of data

    -   Insert t-test numbers

    -   Insert plot for t-test results

-   Barchart of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test by model

    -   stats::ks.test(x = y_hat_bag_rf, y = c(train$y, validation$y), exact = TRUE)\$statistic

    -   Tests if the holdout data from each of the 40 models came from the same distribution as the raw data. If `y` is numeric, a two-sample (Smirnov) test of the null hypothesis that `x` and `y` were drawn from the same distribution is performed.

    -   Lines are given for p = 0.05 and p = 0.10,

-   Variance Inflation Factor report

    -   Calculates variance-inflation and generalized variance-inflation factors (VIFs and GVIFs) for linear, generalized linear, and other regression models.

-   Correlation of the data

    -   Presents a table of the correlation of the data.

-   Correlation of the ensemble

    -   Presents a table of the correlation of the ensemble. This can be modified in the function call, such as remove_ensemble_correlations_greater_than = 0.98 (or whatever value is most useful)

-   Summary report

-   Function call

-   Warnings or errors

-   The stories in the plots

# Strongest evidence based data:
