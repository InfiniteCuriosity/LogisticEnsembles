* This is a new release.
The only note states that "Adding so many packages to the search path is excessive and importing
  selectively is preferable."
The package has been tested on multiple different systems, and always ran without any errors or warnings. Removing any of the packages will either reduce the accuracy, or the results to the user (such as summary graphs).
